HOW TO PLAY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gravity affects both obstacles (gray rectangles) and the blue square, but all 
below interactions are done with the blue square.

The yellow stars have a gravitational pull.
The black stars have a gravitational push, I guess.
Hitting the stars will restart the level.

The objective is to hit the red rectangle. However, the key (the orange square)
must be hit first, or else the objective will stay red even when hit.
